# Burger App - Eat That Burger!

## Introduction
Eat That Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.  Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page, waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour It! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.  Users also have the option to delete devoured burgers from the database.
